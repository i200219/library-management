# Reservation and Delete Book Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of reservation and delete book functionality for the university management system. The implementation includes database schema changes, API routes, UI components, and integration with existing functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Book Reservation System
- **Queue-based reservations**: Users can reserve books when they're not available
- **Priority positioning**: First-come, first-served queue system
- **Expiry management**: Reservations expire after 7 days
- **Status tracking**: ACTIVE, FULFILLED, CANCELLED, EXPIRED statuses
- **User restrictions**: One active reservation per book per user
- **Availability checks**: Prevents reservations when books are available for direct borrowing

### 2. Book Deletion System (Admin Only)
- **Safe deletion**: Prevents deletion when there are active borrows or reservations
- **Cascade cleanup**: Removes all related records (borrow history, reservations)
- **Admin authorization**: Only admin users can delete books
- **Confirmation dialog**: UI confirmation with warnings about permanent deletion

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `reservations`
```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    book_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    reservation_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    expiry_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    status reservation_status DEFAULT 'ACTIVE' NOT NULL,
    priority_position INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### New Enum: `reservation_status`
- ACTIVE: Active reservation in queue
- FULFILLED: Reservation fulfilled (user got the book)
- CANCELLED: User cancelled the reservation
- EXPIRED: Reservation expired due to time limit

## API Routes Implemented

### 1. `/api/reservations` (GET, POST, PATCH)
- **GET**: Fetch user reservations or all reservations (admin)
- **POST**: Create new reservation
- **PATCH**: Update reservation status (cancel, fulfill, expire)

### 2. `/api/books/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- **GET**: Fetch individual book details
- **PUT**: Update book details (admin only)
- **DELETE**: Delete book with safety checks (admin only)

## Components Created

### User Components
1. **`ReserveBook.tsx`**: Button component for reserving books
2. **`ReservationsList.tsx`**: Display user's reservations with cancel functionality

### Admin Components
1. **`DeleteBook.tsx`**: Delete book dialog with confirmation and warnings
2. **`ReservationsManager.tsx`**: Admin interface for managing all reservations

## Server Actions
- **`lib/actions/reservation.ts`**: Server-side functions for reservation management
  - `createReservation()`: Create new reservation
  - `cancelReservation()`: Cancel user reservation
  - `getUserReservations()`: Get user's reservations
  - `getBookReservationQueue()`: Get reservation queue for a book
  - `deleteBook()`: Delete book with safety checks

## UI Integration

### User Interface
- **Book Detail Page**: Added reserve button when book is unavailable
- **User Profile Page**: Added reservations section showing active and past reservations
- **Reservation Management**: Users can view queue position, expiry dates, and cancel reservations

### Admin Interface
- **Admin Sidebar**: Added "Reservations" link
- **Book Detail Page**: Added delete book button with confirmation dialog
- **Reservations Management Page**: Admin can view, fulfill, and expire reservations
- **Safety Features**: Prevents deletion of books with active borrows/reservations

## Business Logic

### Reservation Rules
1. Users cannot reserve books they currently have borrowed
2. Users cannot have multiple active reservations for the same book
3. Reservations are only allowed when books are unavailable
4. Queue position is determined by reservation date (FIFO)
5. Reservations expire after 7 days
6. Users can cancel their own active reservations

### Deletion Rules
1. Only admin users can delete books
2. Books with active borrows cannot be deleted
3. Books with active reservations cannot be deleted
4. Deletion removes all related records (cascade delete)
5. Confirmation required with clear warnings

## Security Features
- **Authentication**: All operations require valid user session
- **Authorization**: Admin-only operations properly protected
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated on both client and server
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries with Drizzle ORM
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protection

## Error Handling
- **User-friendly messages**: Clear error messages for all failure scenarios
- **Graceful degradation**: UI handles loading and error states
- **Validation feedback**: Real-time validation with helpful messages
- **Retry mechanisms**: Users can retry failed operations

## Files Modified/Created

### Database
- `database/schema.ts` - Added reservations table and enum
- `database/reservation-migration.sql` - SQL migration script

### API Routes
- `app/api/reservations/route.ts` - Reservation management API
- `app/api/books/[id]/route.ts` - Individual book operations API

### Components
- `components/ReserveBook.tsx` - Reserve book button
- `components/ReservationsList.tsx` - User reservations display
- `components/admin/DeleteBook.tsx` - Delete book dialog
- `components/admin/ReservationsManager.tsx` - Admin reservations management

### Server Actions
- `lib/actions/reservation.ts` - Reservation server actions

### Pages
- `app/admin/reservations/page.tsx` - Admin reservations page
- Updated `app/(root)/my-profile/page.tsx` - Added reservations section
- Updated `app/admin/books/[id]/page.tsx` - Added delete functionality
- Updated `components/BookOverviewClient.tsx` - Added reserve button

### Configuration
- `types.d.ts` - Added reservation types
- `constants/index.ts` - Added reservations to admin sidebar

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Reservation Flow**:
   - [ ] Reserve unavailable book
   - [ ] Check queue position
   - [ ] Cancel reservation
   - [ ] Verify expiry handling

2. **Admin Delete Flow**:
   - [ ] Try deleting book with active borrows (should fail)
   - [ ] Try deleting book with active reservations (should fail)
   - [ ] Successfully delete book with no dependencies
   - [ ] Verify cascade deletion of related records

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - [ ] Multiple users reserving same book
   - [ ] Reservation expiry scenarios
   - [ ] Concurrent operations
   - [ ] Invalid user permissions

### Database Migration
Before testing, run the reservation migration:
```sql
-- Execute the contents of database/reservation-migration.sql
-- Or use your preferred migration tool
```

## Performance Considerations
- **Indexed queries**: Added indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Efficient joins**: Optimized database queries with proper joins
- **Pagination**: Consider adding pagination for large reservation lists
- **Caching**: Consider caching reservation counts and queue positions

## Future Enhancements
1. **Email notifications**: Notify users when reserved books become available
2. **Reservation limits**: Limit number of active reservations per user
3. **Priority reservations**: VIP or faculty priority queues
4. **Bulk operations**: Admin bulk reservation management
5. **Analytics**: Reservation statistics and reporting
6. **Mobile optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience for reservations

## Conclusion
The reservation and delete book functionality has been successfully implemented with comprehensive error handling, security measures, and user-friendly interfaces. The system maintains data integrity while providing powerful features for both users and administrators.
